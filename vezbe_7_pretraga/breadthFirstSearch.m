%This code executes breadth first search.  This simulation is meant to
%mimick a robot navigating through a grid and planning a path around
%obstacles.  The user defines the obstacles, goal, and starting position.  
%This simulation is set up for a 5 x 5 grid that ranges from (0,0) to
%(5,5).  This code is written for Matlab 7.0.
